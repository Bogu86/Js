Cel projektu:
    From scratch, build a React form for a school administrator. This form should have input text fields for:

    First name
    Last name
    Age
    Address
    Homeroom class number
    Student ID
    As the user inputs the student’s data in each field, the inputted values should be updated and shown on the screen for them to see that it is being received.

    Add a radio-type input allowing the user to track a student’s favorite lunch option. You can determine what lunch will be theoretically served at the school!

Uwagi :
Komponent Input pisany "z ręki"
Komponent RadioOptions zbudowany z pomocą ChatuGpT.
